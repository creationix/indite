A git based blogging system for technical writings.

 - Every article is a branch.
 - Skins are also branches.
 - Skins and articles can be written and tested entirely offline.
 - Initial content is rendered by server and send to client as pre-rendered HTML.
 - Once client has copy of JS code and git repo, it can render everything locally.
 - A chrome or firefox app can also consume the git format and allow reading and publishing.
